 ### Projects

In addition to my academic pursuits in computer Engineering, I actively engage in trying to implement what I have learnt in a simple way, below are some of the projects I have and still working on:

#### 1. Control Systems

- *Description:* Modeling, analysis, and design of analog and digital linear control systems using time and frequency domain techniques. Among skills learned include feedback control system characteristics performance analysis and stability, Z-transforms, and controller design.
- Tools utilized include MATLAB, Simulink and Quanser Qube Library

#### 2. MCU and IoT
- *Description:* Microcontroller techniques for data acquistion, automated running and control implementation through Internet of Things. Tasks completed include a simple MCU bounce ball, interrupts generation and servicing, Motor control and analysis. 
- Currently working on prototype to control water dispensing in farms based on the soil moisture content. 

#### 3. Space Rated Hauling container (COSMOCRATE)
- *Description:* I was a member of a 8 member team tasked with creating a payload hauling container to Deep Space and Mars to facilitate its colonization. My roles included identifying electronics and analysing the electrical needs of the project. Motor assembly and code development were among the tasks I got involved in. In the preliminary semester (Fall 2023, we were able to be ranked 3rd overall.)
- The project is a senior year capstone for engineering students, currently under fabrication.

#### 4. HVAC Systems
- *Description* Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning involves installing AC systems and ensuring the expected flow and control. I'm learning through apprenticing with skilled experts in the field, putting my theory skills to use.
